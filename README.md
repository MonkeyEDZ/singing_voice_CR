# singing_voice_CR
Singing Voice Chord Recognition Algorithm - Developed in Matlab for my Sound Engineering Thesis at UNTREF, Argentina


It is especially directed to analyze formants of Argentinian and Uruguay's singers. The core of the analysis is based on a modification and expansion of the Chroma Toolbox. 

To use, simply load SV_CR GUI.
